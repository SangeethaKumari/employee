This is a RESTful API built with Java Spring Boot that provides CRUD operations for managing tasks.
It follows REST principles of  stateless, client-server communication model using standard HTTP methods and uses Spring Boot architecture.

Spring Boot follows a layered architecture that simplifies building scalable applications. It consists of:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer ‚Äì Handles HTTP requests via Controllers (@RestController) and returns responses (JSON, HTML).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Service Layer ‚Äì Contains business logic (@Service), interacting between the controller and repository.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Repository Layer ‚Äì Uses Spring Data JPA (@Repository) to interact with the database.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Database Layer ‚Äì Stores data using H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or other databases, managed by Hibernate (JPA).

Spring Boot uses auto-configuration, embedded servers (Tomcat), and dependency injection to streamline application development. üöÄ
